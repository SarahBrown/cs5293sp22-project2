# Functions and Approach to Development
* Train (or index for search) food data in provided dataset
* Input ingredients and then use model (or search) to predict type of cuisine and return result
** cuisine distance
* Find the top-N closest foods. Return their IDs (if no ID associated can assign arbitrarily)
** top-N and their distances

## Model vs. Search
### First Approach: Indexed Search
#### dictionary in dictionary
#### Add in Fuzzy


## Calculate distances
